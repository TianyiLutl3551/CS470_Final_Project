Introduction:

The proposed project aims to develop a Course Registration Program that will simplify and streamline the course registration process for students and administrators at an educational institution. The program will be implemented in either Java or C++ and will be made available on GitHub to ensure transparency and collaboration among all project participants.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient course registration system that allows students to easily select, enroll, and manage their courses. The system will provide administrators with tools to oversee the registration process, monitor course capacities, and generate relevant reports.

Features:
Import Files: The system will be able to import an existing file(CSV) that allows the user to manipulate.
Student Registration: Students will be able to browse through available courses, view course details, and register for their desired courses using a simple and intuitive interface.

Course Management:
 Administrators will have the capability to add new courses, update course information, set maximum enrollment capacities, and manage course schedules.

Prerequisite Validation: 
The system will validate whether students meet the prerequisites for specific courses before allowing them to register, ensuring that students are eligible for the selected courses.

Conflict Resolution: 
The program will detect and prevent students from registering for courses with overlapping schedules, avoiding time conflicts.
User Authentication: 
To maintain data security, the system will implement user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the registration data.

Registration Reports: 
The system will generate reports for administrators, displaying the enrollment status of each course and providing insights into registration trends.

Technologies:
The Course Registration Program will be implemented in Java GUI.

Conclusion:
The Course Registration Program is envisioned to enhance the efficiency and user experience of the course registration process. By providing an easy-to-use platform for both students and administrators, the system will contribute to a smoother registration process, reduce administrative overhead, and ultimately improve the educational institution's overall course management.
